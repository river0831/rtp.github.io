    description: is currently a research fellow in University of California, Davis. Her research interests include Development of new methods for unknown xenobiotics transformation products discovery, characterization of the toxicity mechanism using global omics method (e.g., metabolomics and transcriptomics), and identification of active compounds in complex mixtures using high-resolution mass spectrometry.

      alt: Fang Mingliang
    description: is currently a professor at Fudan University, Shanghai, China. His previous research experience focused strongly on the application of high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), high-throughput bioassays and omics-technology to identify novel emerging organic contaminants, investigate human exposure, identify representative biomarkers and characterize possible health effects. Specifically, his interested fields include â€‹1. High-resolution mass spectrometry based metabolomics and lipidomics application in risk assessment; 2. Occurrences of emerging environmental contaminants in indoor environment; 3. Human exposome and biomarker discovery based on non-targeted xenobiotic transformation; 4. Nuclear-receptor related endocrine disruption and immune response initiated by environmental contaminants; 5. Effect-directed analysis to screen bio-active compounds in complex mixtures.
